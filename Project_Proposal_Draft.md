# Project Proposal Draft
## Motivation
Twitter has long been one of the biggest social media platforms worldwide. Although it took a while for politicians to recognise the power of this platform, Donald Trumpâ€™s aggressive use of twitter as a platform to reach his followers bevor and during his presidency has cemented twitter as one of the main platforms to follow the political debates. With the 2020 presidential election in the books and heavily discussed on twitter by followers of both Donald Trump and his contender Joe Biden we want to analyse these tweets to gain a better understanding of the deciding factors in this election.

The goal of this project is to answer the question if people living in areas of higher income and better education have a more positive sentiment towards Joe Biden compared to people residing in regions of lower income and less education. Our hypothesis is that there is a positive relationship between education/income and the sentiment towards Joe Biden. 

After we perform our sentiment analysis and tested our hypothesis, we also want to use the election results to analyse if we can observe a higher correlation between the election results and the sentiment towards Joe Biden in certain areas compared to just using corelation of education/income and election results. Especially for this election where many voter's motivation was to vote against Donald Trump and not for Joe Biden we can expect interesting results.

## Project Plan
1.	Download recent tweets about Joe Biden
2.	Analyse the twitter data using sentiment analyses (e.g., VADER)
3.	Test our sentiment analysis method against a smaller, by hand annotated data set
4.	Cluster the tweeds by geolocation
5.	Match census data about education and income to tweets by their geolocation
6.	Test our hypothesis to see if we can indeed see a correlation between education/income and the sentiment about Joe Biden
7.	Compare our findings with the 2020 presidential election results
